If anyone wants to play just download "Mygame.rar" extract which contains a basic prototype of this game.

WebGL build to this game along with some updated features 
## https://play.unity.com/en/games/b9c86a3a-c81a-44df-b97c-88d7a93ce240/webgl-builds
Although its just a prototype of a project I was working on to pitch up for a stealth startup but it didnt work out well so thought of uploading it as RAW needs a few code changes to make it more smooth and fascinating.
